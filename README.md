This script was written for my 4th co-op term at Christie Digital. I was given the task of manually verifying connections between different components on electrical schematics. Instead, I wrote a script which would use .asc netlist files and user input in CSV files to automatically determine connections.

The accompanying report is attached with this to understand the background.

The main script is in system_connections.py and netlist.py.
